# SpaceX_Capstone

🔍 What was the goal?
This project aimed to analyze SpaceX's historical launch data to understand key factors contributing to mission success, predict future launch outcomes, and optimize the scheduling of launches for maximum efficiency.

💡 Key Highlights:

- Data Collection: Gathered and cleaned datasets from multiple sources, including SpaceX's public API and historical records.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns in launch success rates relative to variables such as payload weight, launch site, and rocket type.

- Predictive Modeling: Built machine learning models that predict launch success probabilities, using algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost.

- Optimization: Developed a scheduling model that minimizes downtime and maximizes the success rate of launches, leveraging linear programming techniques.

📊 Challenges Overcome:

- Data Gaps: Had to deal with missing data and inconsistent records, which required innovative imputation techniques.

- Model Accuracy: Fine-tuned models to ensure they are robust and generalizable, achieving an accuracy rate of over 90% in predictions.

- Scalability: Ensured that the models could handle future expansions in the dataset as SpaceX continues to push the boundaries of space exploration.
